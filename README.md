Sherlock Holmes and removing of characters

Wow! This problem is kind of tricky. If you're ready to put your thinking cap on, brace yourself and good luck! Otherwise, you can skip it for now and return any time later
For this problem, imagine that you are Sherlock Holmes. You've deduced that the clues are somehow hidden within the pairs of words that contain only the same letters with the same frequencies. To crack the case, you now need to find out how many characters must be deleted to get such words (character sequences) from the given ones.

For example: for two words "case" and "seal" you'll need to remove characters "c" and "l" respectively to get "ase" and "sea". In this case, the answer is 2 ("c" and "l").

Remember: these "words" are case-insensitive


Sample Input:
case
seal

Sample Output:
2


Sample Input:
Poooohgf
poohgf

Sample Output:
2


Sample Input:
write
write

Sample Output:
0
